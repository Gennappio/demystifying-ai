# Why Neural Networks

This repository contains all the supporting material for the talk [Cosa Sono queste reti neurali](https://www.facebook.com/pg/sprintlab.it/photos/?tab=album&album_id=187572655263469).
The slides are interactive and can be run during the presentation.

## Setup

1. setup [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux) or [miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html)
2. create a virtual environment
  ```
  # please use python 3 :)
  $conda create --name dl python=3.6

  #activate the environment
  source activate dl
  ```
3. install the needed libraries
  ```
  $pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
4. run the [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebook service
  ```
  $ jupyter notebook
  ```

If you want to get more information about anaconda and jupyter check the [presentation + tutorials](https://github.com/fabiofumarola/anaconda_jupyter_tutorial) made for the [School of Artificial Intelligence at PiCampus](http://picampus-school.com/).
